Texas Medicine is TMA's flagship print + digital publication — bimonthly, reaching the full TMA membership. Covers public health, medicolegal, medical economics, coding/billing, and legislative affairs. BillitMD is a natural editorial fit (billing + AI = their readers' pain point).

3. Request editorial calendar to align ad with billing/coding-themed issues
4. Pitch a possible "sponsored editorial" or advertorial about AI billing — some issues accept these

---

**URL:** https://www.texmed.org/Marketing/

**Next Steps:**
1. Request the full TMA Media Kit from Belinda — it will show newsletter open rates, audience segmentation, pricing
2. Ask specifically about targeting **solo/independent practice** physicians (TMA tracks this in their member data)

---

### 1c. TMA 360 Vendor Program
**URL:** https://www.texmed.org/TMA360Vendor/

The 360 Vendor Program is TMA's year-round partner/affiliate program for businesses serving physicians. It provides ongoing visibility across TMA channels — not just a one-time ad buy.

**Next Steps:**
1. Call Belinda at 512-370-1423 and ask for the 360 Vendor Program prospectus + pricing

## 4. Doximity

**Overview:** Doximity is the LinkedIn of medicine — 2 million+ HCP members, 80% of U.S. MDs, 50% of NPs/PAs. Physicians use it daily for clinical news, secure messaging, telemedicine, and professional networking.

- **Main marketing page:** https://www.doximity.com/marketing-solutions
- **Self-service platform (new):** https://rx.doximity.com/portal/contact
- **Contact form:** https://www.doximity.com/marketing-solutions/contact
- **Medical Affairs solutions:** https://marketingsolutions.doximity.info/medical-affairs

---

### 4a. Advertising on Doximity

Doximity is primarily oriented toward pharma and large health system advertisers, but they have introduced a self-service option relevant to startups.

**Key products:**
- **DocNews® Sponsored Content:** Native sponsored content in physicians' personalized newsfeed. Highly targeted by specialty, geography, practice type. This is the core ad unit.
- **Self-Service Ads (new):** Fine-tune your audience and run campaigns independently. Now in early access — sign up at https://rx.doximity.com/portal/contact
- **Median ROI reported:** >11:1 (Doximity's own claim — take with a grain of salt, but engagement is high vs. other channels)

**Pricing:** Doximity does **not publish public pricing**. It is quote-based and typically starts at $10,000–$25,000/campaign minimum for managed service. Self-service may have lower minimums — request a quote.

**Targeting capability for BillitMD:**
- Specialty: Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Practice
- Geography: Texas (all or specific metro areas)
- Practice type: Solo practice / independent (Doximity has this data)
- NPI-level targeting available

---

### 4b. How Physicians Discover Tools on Doximity

1. **DocNews feed:** Personalized clinical news + sponsored content appears in the main feed when physicians check in daily
2. **Dialer/Fax tools:** Physicians use Doximity's workflow tools throughout the day — banner/contextual placements exist within these workflows
3. **Colleague recommendations:** Physicians can recommend tools/services in their network; word-of-mouth is powerful on the platform
4. **There are no free "company pages" like LinkedIn** — Doximity does not allow non-physician brands to have organic profile pages

---

### 4c. Doximity Organic Strategy (No-Cost)

Since there's no free company presence on Doximity, organic reach requires using physician advocates:

1. **Find physicians already using or willing to try BillitMD** and ask them to share their experience on Doximity's feed
2. **Physician influencers on Doximity** (physicians with large followings who discuss practice management) — find them and offer free access in exchange for an honest review post
3. **Apply to Doximity Talent Finder / Newsfeed PR** — pitch a news angle about AI billing optimization to the Doximity editorial team for organic news coverage

**Next Steps:**
1. Go to https://rx.doximity.com/portal/contact and request early access to self-service ads
2. Fill out the contact form at https://www.doximity.com/marketing-solutions/contact for a managed campaign quote
3. Target: Family Medicine physicians, Texas, solo/small practice — estimated audience 5,000–8,000 physicians
4. **Budget expectation:** Plan $5,000–$15,000 for a meaningful Doximity campaign if going managed; self-service TBD

---

## 5. Texas Physician Facebook Groups

**Overview:** Facebook groups are where solo/independent physicians talk candidly about practice headaches — billing, EHRs, insurance. The most conversational, trust-building channel.

> ⚠️ **Critical rule:** Most physician Facebook groups have strict no-promotion policies. Direct promotion = ban. Strategy must be **value-first, organic engagement** unless the group explicitly allows vendor posts.

---

### Active Texas Physician Facebook Groups to Target

| Group Name | Est. Members | Type | Promo OK? |
|-----------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Texas Physicians** | Search on Facebook — varies | General TX physicians | Usually no |
| **Independent Physicians of Texas** | Search — ~500–2,000 | Solo/indie focus | Sometimes with disclosure |
| **Women Physicians of Texas** | Search — ~1,000–5,000 | Women MDs in TX | No promotion; engage as ally |
| **Texas Family Medicine Physicians** | Search — varies | FM specialty, TX | No |
| **Independent Medical Practice Owners** (national, includes TX) | ~5,000–15,000 | Practice owners | Vendor-friendly, check rules |
| **Direct Primary Care Physicians** (national) | ~10,000+ | DPC model | Very vendor-friendly |
| **Physician Side Gigs** (national) | ~20,000+ | Entrepreneurial MDs | Vendor-friendly |
| **r/medicine, r/FamilyMedicine Facebook equivalents** | Varies | General clinical | No |

> **How to find current groups:** Log into Facebook, search "Texas physicians" / "independent doctors Texas" / "Texas family medicine" — check member counts, last post date, and group rules before joining.

---

### Engagement Strategy (What Actually Works)

**Phase 1 — Join and listen (weeks 1–2):**
- Join 5–8 groups
- Read posts. Understand what billing pains are being discussed
- Do NOT post anything about BillitMD yet

**Phase 2 — Contribute value (weeks 2–6):**
- Answer questions about billing, coding, ICD-10 — establish yourself as knowledgeable
- If Matthew has an MD or clinical background, this is even more powerful
- Share genuinely useful content (not BillitMD branded) — billing tips, coding changes, payer policy updates

**Phase 3 — Soft introduction (week 6+):**
- Make a post like: *"I've been building something to solve the exact billing problem we keep discussing here — an AI tool that optimizes CPT/ICD-10 codes for solo practices. Would a few people be willing to beta test it and tell me if it's actually useful?"*
- This is an invitation to collaborate, not a sales pitch — it gets dramatically better response

**Phase 4 — Ask the admin:**
- In groups where the admin is active, DM them and introduce BillitMD professionally
- Offer a free demo or license for the admin/group to use
- Some admins will allow a pinned post or "vendor spotlight" in exchange

## 7. LinkedIn Targeting Strategy

**Overview:** LinkedIn is the most scalable self-serve channel for reaching physician practice owners. No minimum spend, precise targeting, and messaging capability.

---

### 7a. Can You Use Basic LinkedIn? Yes, but with limits.

| Tool | What You Can Do | Limitation |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Free LinkedIn** | Manual search, connect with individuals, post content | Can't export lists, limited searches/month, can't filter by company size |
| **LinkedIn Basic ($40–60/mo)** | More profile views, some InMail credits | Still no advanced filters |
| **Sales Navigator Core ($99/mo)** | Full advanced filters, save lists of 2,500 leads, InMail messages, account targeting, CRM sync | **Recommended for BillitMD** |
| **Sales Navigator Advanced ($149/mo)** | Team sharing, full org charts, more features | Overkill for now |

---

### 7b. Exact Search Filters on Sales Navigator

To find solo/small practice physician practice owners in Texas:

**People Search Filters:**
```
Geography: Texas (United States)
Job Title (include ALL of these as separate entries):
  - "Physician"
  - "Medical Doctor"
  - "MD"
  - "DO"
  - "Family Physician"
  - "Internal Medicine Physician"
  - "General Practitioner"
  - "Practice Owner"
  - "Solo Practice"
Seniority Level: Owner, Partner, C-Level
Company headcount: 1–10 employees
Industry: Hospital & Health Care, Medical Practice
Keywords (optional): "independent practice" OR "private practice" OR "solo"
```

**Account Search Filters (to find practice accounts):**
```
Geography: Texas
Industry: Medical Practice
Company Size: 1–10 employees
Keywords: "Medical Associates" OR "Family Medicine" OR "Internal Medicine" OR "Medical Group"
```

**Estimated Audience Size:** 8,000–20,000 physician profiles in Texas matching small/solo practice filters. Many are owner-operators even if their profile doesn't explicitly say "owner."

---

### 7c. Connection + Message Template

**Connection Request Note (300 char limit):**
> "Hi [Name] — I'm building an AI billing optimizer specifically for independent Texas physicians. Would love to connect and get your thoughts on the biggest billing headaches you face."

**Follow-up Message #1 (after accepting):**
> "Thanks for connecting, [Name]. Quick question — do you handle your own billing in-house, or do you use a billing service?
>
> I'm building BillitMD — an AI tool that optimizes CPT and ICD-10 codes to reduce claim denials and maximize reimbursement for solo/small practices. It takes seconds, not hours.
>
> We're building our early user waitlist now and offering the first 100 Texas physicians free access. Interested? [link to landing page]"

**Follow-up Message #2 (if no response after 5 days):**
> "Following up briefly — if billing optimization isn't a pain point for you, totally fine. But if you've ever lost revenue to undercoded claims or had insurance denials, I'd love 5 minutes to show you what we're doing. No pitch, just a demo."

---

### 7d. Organic LinkedIn Content Strategy

Post from a personal profile (Matthew's), not a company page, for maximum reach:

1. **Posts about billing pain points** — "Did you know the avg independent physician leaves $50K/year on the table from undercoding?" — no product mention, just education
2. **Behind-the-scenes building posts** — "We're building an AI billing optimizer for Texas solo physicians. Here's what I've learned from 50 physician conversations..." — generates inbound curiosity
3. **Share physician stories/stats** — billing complexity data, payer trend changes, posts that resonate with the audience
4. **Engagement frequency:** 3–4 posts/week minimum to gain LinkedIn algorithm traction

---

## 8. Apollo.io / ZoomInfo for Cold Email

Industry: "Medical Practice" OR "Health, Wellness and Fitness" OR "Hospital & Health Care"
Company Size: 1–10 employees (critical — this excludes hospital-employed physicians)
Has Email: Yes (verified emails only)
```

**Estimated List Size:** Apollo typically returns 5,000–15,000 Texas physician records at small company size. Expect ~30–50% verified email rate. Realistic deliverable list: **2,000–5,000 physician emails.**

**Quality note:** Apollo's physician data quality varies. Always validate emails before sending (use NeverBounce or ZeroBounce, ~$0.008/email). Target a <2% bounce rate to protect your domain.

### 8b. ZoomInfo (Premium Alternative)

**Website:** https://www.zoominfo.com  
**Pricing:** Not public. Typically starts at **$15,000–$25,000/year** for a license — this is enterprise pricing. Way too expensive for a startup.

**Better alternative:** Use Apollo + NPI Registry instead of ZoomInfo. ZoomInfo is for enterprise sales teams with 6-figure budgets.

---

### 8c. NPI Registry (FREE — Best Source for Texas Physicians)

This is the government's public physician database and has no scraping restrictions.

**URL:** https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/search  
**Direct API:** https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/

**Filters:**
- Provider Type: Individual (MD, DO)
- State: TX
- Taxonomy: Family Medicine (207Q00000X), Internal Medicine (207R00000X), General Practice (208D00000X)

**What you get (free):** NPI number, full name, credential, practice address, city, zip, phone number, taxonomy (specialty). **No email.** But the address + name can be matched to email via Apollo.

**Workflow:**
1. Export NPI data for Texas Family Medicine + Internal Medicine MDs
2. Filter for solo/small practices (single NPI, no group affiliation)
3. Cross-reference with Apollo to find email addresses
4. Build your outreach list

### 8d. CAN-SPAM Compliance Notes

All cold email must comply with CAN-SPAM (federal law):

| Requirement | How to Comply |
|-------------|--------------|
| Clear sender ID | Use a real name + domain (e.g., matthew@billitmd.com) |
| No deceptive subject lines | "Quick question about billing" ✓ / "You've been selected!" ✗ |
| Physical address required | Include your business address in every email |
| Clear opt-out mechanism | "Unsubscribe" link in every email — required |
| Honor unsubscribes within 10 days | Use an ESP (Mailshake, Lemlist, etc.) that auto-manages this |
| No harvested/purchased lists from shady sources | Apollo and NPI registry = clean |

**Email domain warning:** Do NOT send cold emails from your main @billitmd.com domain. Use a warm subdomain (e.g., outreach.billitmd.com) and warm it up over 4–6 weeks with a warm-up tool (Instantly.ai, Lemwarm). Sending cold to a cold domain = spam folder.

## 9. Reddit Communities

**Overview:** Reddit has active physician communities. No hard selling — ever. The only successful approach is genuine participation and organic credibility-building.

---

### Relevant Subreddits

| Subreddit | Subscribers | Who's There | Promo Rules |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **r/medicine** | ~500K | MDs, DOs, APPs worldwide — verified credentials required to post | **Zero promotion allowed.** Verified flair required. Highly moderated. Lurk and add clinical value only. |
| **r/FamilyMedicine** | ~50K | Family medicine physicians + residents | **No self-promotion.** Some posts restricted to verified physicians. Best engagement for billing/practice topics. |
| **r/physicians** | ~75K | US physicians, practice management discussion | **No overt promotion.** Can post tools/resources framed as "found this helpful." |
| **r/HealthcareIT** | ~25K | Health IT professionals, some physicians | More tolerant of relevant product discussion. Can post BillitMD as a tool post. |
| **r/MedicalBilling** | ~15K | Billers, coders, office managers — some physicians | Most relevant for billing pain points. More flexible on product mentions if framed as solution. |
| **r/DoctorsLounge** | ~5K | Small physician community, practice-focused | Smaller but highly relevant. Check rules before posting. |
| **r/privatepractice** (if it exists) | Varies | Independent practice owners | Search and check current status |
| **r/IndependentPhysician** (if it exists) | Varies | Independent practice owners | Search and check current status |

### Rules Deep-Dive for Key Subreddits

**r/medicine:**
- Account must be >7 days old AND have >10 comment karma before posting
- Must set user flair indicating role
- Absolutely no promotion — posts are removed and users banned
- **Strategy:** Comment meaningfully on billing/admin frustration threads. Build credibility over months. Never mention BillitMD until you're established.

**r/FamilyMedicine:**
- Physicians and APPs only for verified posts
- Some posts require verified flair (contact mods to verify)
- No self-promotion, but asking for feedback on a tool you're building is often tolerated
- **Strategy:** Post a genuine "I'm building an AI billing tool — what are the biggest billing pain points in family medicine?" — this is a question, not a pitch, and gets excellent responses

**r/HealthcareIT:**
- More tolerant of technology product discussion
- Frame BillitMD as a solution to a technical/operational problem
- **Strategy:** Post: "I built an AI billing code optimizer for independent physician practices — happy to share what I learned about the technical challenges if anyone's interested"

---

### Reddit Engagement Playbook

1. **Week 1–2:** Read only. Understand the culture, vocabulary, ongoing debates.
2. **Week 2–4:** Comment on existing threads about billing, coding frustration, insurance denials. Be genuinely helpful.
3. **Week 4+:** Start a discussion post in r/FamilyMedicine or r/physicians: *"I'm a [your background] building a tool for physician billing optimization — would love brutal feedback from anyone who's dealt with billing software frustration. No pitch, just want to learn."*
4. **Always:** Include a disclosure if you're the founder. The Reddit physician community respects transparency and eviscerates fake grassroots.

## 10. Google Maps / Texas Medical Board Data

---

### 10a. Texas Medical Board — Physician Search

**Primary search tool:** https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/Search.aspx?135a91a3-a770-49e6-a164-294696a6ff9f  
**Info page:** https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/resources/for-the-public/look-up-a-license  
**Older DocFinder tool:** http://docfinder.docboard.org/tx/df/txsearch.htm

**What's publicly available:**
- Physician name and credentials
- License number and status
- Practice address and phone number
- Specialty/taxonomy
- Board actions (if any)
- Data updated daily

**Can you scrape it?**  
Technically the data is public, but the TMB site explicitly states: *"This system is intended solely for use with the automated verification system. Unauthorized access or use is strictly prohibited and may result in civil and criminal penalties."*

**Legal scraping status: RISKY.** Do not scrape the TMB website directly.

**✅ Better alternative — CMS NPI Registry (completely legal, free, bulk download):**
- **Bulk download:** https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html (full national NPI database, updated monthly)
- **API search:** https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/
- Filter for Texas + physician taxonomy codes
- No terms of service prohibiting bulk use — this is CMS public data designed for exactly this purpose
- Contains: NPI, name, credentials, practice address, phone, taxonomy, business name
- **Taxonomy codes for your targets:**
  - 207Q00000X = Family Medicine
  - 207R00000X = Internal Medicine
  - 208D00000X = General Practice
  - 207P00000X = Emergency Medicine (less relevant)

---

### 10b. Google Maps for Solo Practice Discovery

**Search queries to use on Google Maps:**

```
"family medicine" Texas
"internal medicine clinic" Houston
"solo physician" Dallas TX
"private practice" Austin Texas
"independent doctor" San Antonio
"family practice" Fort Worth
"general practitioner" Texas
```

**What you get:** Practice name, address, phone, website, reviews — often better than the NPI registry for identifying truly independent (non-hospital-affiliated) practices, since Google Maps shows business names that reveal affiliation (e.g., "Baylor Family Medicine" = hospital-employed; "Smith Family Medicine" = likely independent).

**Manual research workflow:**
1. Search a specific city + specialty on Google Maps
2. Filter for small results — if a clinic has 5+ MDs listed, skip; solo/duo practices are your target
3. Note the practice name, phone, and website
4. Cross-reference with LinkedIn/Apollo to find the physician's email

**Automated approach:** Tools like Outscraper (outscraper.com) or PhantomBuster can pull Google Maps results at scale. This is a gray area — Google's ToS prohibits scraping, but using a tool like Outscraper (which takes responsibility for the scraping via their API) is widely used. Expect to pay $0.001–$0.01 per record.
