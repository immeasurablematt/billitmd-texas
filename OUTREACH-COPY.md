## 1. Cold Email (Apollo.io / Direct)

**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- A: "You're probably undercoding — most Texas docs are"
- B: "Quick question about your billing workflow"
- C: "$40K/year in missed billing codes"

**Body:**

> Hi Dr. {Last Name},
>
> I'm reaching out because we're building something specifically for independent Texas physicians.
>
> BillitMD is an AI tool that reads your encounter notes and recommends the CPT codes your documentation actually supports — including add-on codes and E&M levels most solo practices miss.
>
> The average independent physician loses $30,000–$80,000/year to undercoding. We're fixing that.
>
> We're opening early access for Texas practices soon. If you're interested in being first in line (and locking in founding-member pricing), you can join the waitlist here:
>

>
> No patient data ever leaves your device. Takes 60 seconds per encounter. Works with your existing EHR.
>
> Happy to answer any questions.

> Best,

**Follow-up (5 days later, no reply):**

> Hi Dr. {Last Name},
>
> Just bumping this — we're getting close to opening the Texas beta and I wanted to make sure you had a chance to get on the list.
>
> If billing optimization isn't a pain point for your practice, no worries at all. But if you're spending hours on coding or suspect you're leaving money on the table, this is built for you.

## 2. LinkedIn Connection Request + Message

**Connection request note (300 char limit):**

> Hi Dr. {Last Name} — I'm building an AI billing optimization tool for independent Texas physicians. We're opening early access soon and I'd love to connect. No sales pitch, just sharing what we're working on.

**Follow-up message (after connection accepted):**

> Thanks for connecting, Dr. {Last Name}.
>
> Quick context: BillitMD analyzes encounter notes and recommends optimal CPT/HCPCS codes — including add-ons and E&M levels most solo practices miss. Average revenue recovery is $30K–$80K/year per physician.
>
> We're launching the Texas beta soon. If that sounds relevant to your practice, here's the waitlist:
> https://billitmd-texas-landing.vercel.app?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=texas_waitlist

> Would love your feedback either way. What's the biggest billing headache in your practice right now?

## 3. Reddit Posts (Organic, Not Salesy)

**For r/medicine or r/familymedicine:**

> **Title:** For solo/small practice docs — how do you handle billing code optimization?
>
> I'm curious how other independent physicians approach CPT code selection, especially with multi-payer complexity. I run a small practice and realized I was consistently undercoding office visits and missing add-on codes — probably leaving $30-40K/year on the table.
>
> Been working on an AI tool that reads encounter notes and suggests optimal codes with justifications. Testing it in Texas right now.
>
> For those of you in solo or small group practice: do you have a billing person who catches these? Do you feel confident you're billing at the right E&M level every time? What would you want from a tool like this?

**For r/healthIT:**

> **Title:** Building AI billing code optimization for small practices — looking for feedback from the healthIT side
>
> Working on a tool (BillitMD) that takes physician encounter notes and recommends optimal CPT/HCPCS codes. Think of it as a code review layer between the physician and claim submission.
>
> Architecture: all PHI stays client-side (IndexedDB), AI does classification and code recommendation, validation layer checks NCCI edits and bundling conflicts before output.
>
> Targeting solo/small practices in Texas for the initial launch. The enterprise autonomous coding space (Nym Health, CodaMetrix) is well-funded but nobody's building an affordable self-serve tool for the 3-doctor family practice.
>
> Would love feedback from anyone in healthIT/RCM on what we should be thinking about.

## 4. Facebook Group Posts (Organic)

**For Texas physician groups:**

> Hey everyone — quick question for the independent practice owners in here.
>
> How confident are you that you're billing at the right E&M level for every encounter? I started digging into my own billing patterns and realized I was consistently leaving money on the table — undercoding office visits, missing eligible add-on codes, not catching modifier opportunities.
>
> I've been working on an AI tool that reads encounter notes and suggests the optimal CPT codes based on what your documentation actually supports. Everything stays on your device (no patient data uploaded anywhere).
>
> We're testing it with Texas practices right now. If anyone's interested in taking a look or giving feedback, I'd really appreciate it: [link]
>
> Not trying to sell anything — we're pre-launch and genuinely looking for input from docs who deal with this daily.

## 5. TMA / TAFP Newsletter Sponsorship

**Ad copy (short, for newsletter placement):**

> **Stop Leaving Revenue on the Table.**
> The average Texas independent physician loses $30,000–$80,000/year to undercoding and missed add-on codes. BillitMD uses AI to optimize your CPT codes from encounter notes — in under 60 seconds. No patient data leaves your device. Built for solo and small practices.
> **→ Join the Texas Waitlist: billitmd.com/texas**

**Longer version (for sponsored content / advertorial):**

> **Texas Independent Physicians: Are You Billing What Your Documentation Supports?**
>
> Multi-payer billing is one of the top reasons physicians sell their practices or join hospital systems. Between Medicare, Medicaid, and a dozen private insurers — each with different modifier rules, documentation requirements, and bundling edits — getting coding right is a full-time job.
>
> BillitMD is an AI-powered billing code optimizer designed specifically for Texas solo and small-group practices. Enter your encounter notes (type or dictate), and BillitMD recommends the optimal CPT and HCPCS codes your documentation supports — with plain-English justifications for each code.
>
> **What makes it different:**
> - Built for independent practices, not hospital systems
> - All patient data stays on your device (HIPAA compliant by design)
> - Works alongside your existing EHR — no rip-and-replace
> - Validation layer checks NCCI edits and bundling conflicts before you submit
> - Results in under 60 seconds per encounter
>
> BillitMD is launching its Texas beta soon. Early access members get priority onboarding and founding-member pricing.

## 6. Doximity Post

> I've been thinking a lot about why independent practice is dying — and billing complexity is near the top of the list.
>
> Here's a stat that bothers me: the average independent physician loses 15–20% of collectible revenue to undercoding, missed add-on codes, and documentation gaps. For a solo doc, that's $30,000–$80,000/year. Enough to hire a part-time MA. Enough to keep the lights on during a slow quarter.
>
> The enterprise players (Nym Health, CodaMetrix, Ambience) are building autonomous coding for hospitals at $500K+ contracts. Nobody's building an affordable, self-serve tool for the family medicine doc in Plano billing from her laptop.
>
> So we're building it. BillitMD reads your encounter notes, recommends optimal CPT/HCPCS codes with justifications, validates against NCCI edits, and gives you output in under a minute. All patient data stays on your device.
>
> We're launching the Texas beta soon. If you're an independent physician in Texas and this resonates, I'd love to hear from you.
